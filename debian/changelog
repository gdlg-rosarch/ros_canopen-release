ros-indigo-socketcan-interface (0.6.5-1trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * removed Baseclass typedef since its use prevented virtual functions calls
  * add missing chrono dependency
  * Added catch-all features in BufferedReader
  * hardened code with the help of cppcheck
  * styled and sorted CMakeLists.txt
    * removed boilerplate comments
    * indention
    * reviewed exported dependencies
  * styled and sorted package.xml
  * update package URLs
  * Improves StateInterface implementation of the DummyInterface.
    The doesLoopBack() method now returns the correct value. A state change is
    correctly dispatched when the init() method is called.
  * Changes inheritance of DummyInterface to DriverInterface.
    Such that this interface can also be used for tests requiring a DriverInterface
    class.
    Test results of the socketcan_interface tests are unchanged by this
    modification as it only uses the CommInterface methods.
  * added socketcan_interface_string to test
  * moved string functions into separate lib
  * Introduced setNotReady, prevent enqueue() to switch from closed to open
  * Reading state_ should be protected by lock
  * improved BufferedReader interface and ScopedEnabler
  * added flush() and max length support to BufferedReader
  * added BufferedReader
  * wake multiple waiting threads if needed
  * pad hex buffer strings in all cases
  * removed unstable StateWaiter::wait_for
